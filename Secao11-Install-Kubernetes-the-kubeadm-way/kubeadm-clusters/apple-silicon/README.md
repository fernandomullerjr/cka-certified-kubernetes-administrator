# Installing Kubernetes the kubeadm way on Apple Silicon

Updated March 2024

In here is the setup specific to newer Apple Silicon (M-series processor) Macs. VirtualBox currently does not have good support for these Macs, therefore we will create the Ubuntu virtual machines using Multipass.

Multipass should also work on older Macs (Intel Core processor), as should [VirtualBox](../virtualbox/).
