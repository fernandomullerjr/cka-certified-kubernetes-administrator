# Connectivity

We will perform most configuration tasks from the `controlplane` node. After the following steps you will be able to use ssh to log into workder nodes from the `cxontrolplane` prompt.

You can if you prefer log into worker nodes from separate terminal sessions using e.g.

```
multipass shell node01
```

## Access all VMs

Here we create an SSH key pair for the `ubuntu` user who we are logged in as. We will copy the public key of this pair to both workers to permit us to use password-less SSH (and SCP) to get from `controlplane` to these other nodes in the context of the `ubuntu` user which exists on all nodes.

Generate Key Pair on `controlplane` node

[//]: # (host:controlplane)

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

Leave all settings to default (just press ENTER at any questions).

Copy the key to the other hosts. For this step please enter `ubuntu` where a password is requested.

The option `-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no` tells it not to ask if you want to connect to a previously unknown host. Not best practice in the real world, but speeds things up here.

```bash
ssh-copy-id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ubuntu@node01
```
```bash
ssh-copy-id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ubuntu@node02
```

For each host, the output should be similar to this. If it is not, then you may have entered an incorrect password. Retry the step.

```
Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'ubuntu@node01'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
```
